# Strategist

Strategist is an addon that saves your strategies into specific matchups in 2v2 and 3v3 arena. This enables players to never forget their strategies and build upon them. Additionally Strategist allows players to share their strategies which greatly reduces the iterative process when learning new matchups.
 
# Features

## Strategy Menu

Displays all current strategies and allows you to edit the strategies of matchups you’ve played already outside of the arena.
 
## Profiles

Create custom profiles with import and exporting support.
 
## Configuration
